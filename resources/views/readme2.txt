MIDDLEWARE;
you must have an admin in your website. not everyone can access admin dashboard that is why we created a middleware and called it Adminmiddleware. it is just like a security guard that stops you from accessing a particular page. the middleware will check the requirements needed before you will be able to access the page. After creating a middleware register it in your kernel.php. give it a name and target where that middleware is created. it is in the middleware that you will write the requirement needed to access the admin dashboard. you must be authenticated and your role must be 1. The admin middlware is related to the web.php. When you try to access the admin dashboard, it will return you back to the login page because you are not authenticated. it doesn't have anything to do with the login controller. The login controller directs user to another page after login. Finfd out how sweet alert works
